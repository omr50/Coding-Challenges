- finished the request phase for parsing the http
    can be re-used for parsing response, somewhat similar

- Before moving on, test it on bigger http body to see if it can handle across multiple requests

- open a new socket for server side, round robin (pick the server)

- send the http string through that socket (nonblocking). 
    this part not that bad since we know the size beforehand
    We can use that to know when we are done.

- Then receive from that socket.
    Parse that response

- Response will be sent through the client socket again.
    How do we know to do that. So for each index in the callback array
    where the index stands for a fd, we have the connection object stored
    there. When we receive the response it would be through a callback and
    that callback would have access to the member variables which include the
    other socket as well (client socket). So we can easily map between sockets
    without some sort of structure.

- Also reading from the forwarding socket (reading server response) would be just
  the same process as reading the request from the client sock.
